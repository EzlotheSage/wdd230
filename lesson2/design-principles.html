            <p>This is an example of Fitt's Law. Fitt's Law states that the time required to reach a 'target' such as a button or menu option is dependent on
                the size and the distance to the target. The proximity of the "advanced search" and other buttons right next to the search bar means that
                it will be quick to adjust to one of those options.

            <p>This is an example of White Space and Clean Design. The XKCD homepage has not changed in a while, and that is because it doesn't really need to. 
                The page is simple, it displays the comics and allows you to reach other extra projects he does, all while keeping the site clean from extraneous 
                ads and elements.

        <div id="columnC">
            <img src="./ruleofthirdsexample.png" alt="an image of the landing page for nike.com" class="screenshotB">
            <p>This is an example of the Rule of Thirds, an organization principle that states that when elements and other images are aligned within columns and rows of 
                three, the content will be easier to understand and be more appealing. The Nike homepage has three columns: one for the left sidebar, one for the right, and a center one
                where the advertisements are placed.
