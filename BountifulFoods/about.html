        <p>
            Bountiful Foods is small business specializing in organic, locally grown foods.
            Operating since 2004, we are physically located in Carlsbad, California but 
            have many food trucks that cover the coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego. 
            We sell fruits and produce directly from the farmers in the area, 
            but also use national and international suppliers. 
            We, as an owner-operated company, cater to walk-in traffic at our storefront 
            in Carlsbad and through our food trucks. We deliver and manage those 
            orders on the phone and via the website. Our mission is to provide fresh and 
            healthy food options, including organic, made to order, fruit drinks, and fruit bags, all 
            to the local population and to tourists visiting the coastal areas. We support healthy eating, 
            organic bounty, and convenience for all our customers.
