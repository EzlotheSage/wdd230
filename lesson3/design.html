      <p class="section-description">This is a paragraph of body text. It uses the Open Sans font at a size of 16 pixels with a line height of 1.5.</p>

      <h3 class="subheading">Basic Reasons</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>I use this font because of its ease of reading and simple forms.</li>
        <li>The colors are meant to represent the oaks of Oak Harbor.</li>
        <li>Pictures of the (imaginary) town could be added later to increase aesthetics.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4 class="subheading">Colors chosen</h4>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>I chose color #8f6b2c because of its simple bark-like color. </li>
        <li>Color #84a98c was chosen because of its similarities to leaves in the summer.</li>
        <li>Black was also used as a way to accent pieces of the site.</li>
